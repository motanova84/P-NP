ACADEMIC AND RESEARCH NOTICE:

This framework presents theoretical results that have not been peer-reviewed.
The mathematical claims require rigorous verification before being accepted
as valid contributions to computational complexity theory.

Users of this framework should:
1. Verify all mathematical claims independently
2. Seek peer review before citing in academic work
3. Treat this as a research proposal, not established theory
4. Exercise appropriate skepticism and critical analysis

No warranty is provided regarding the correctness of the theoretical results.
