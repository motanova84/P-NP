  Oracle Complexity and Non-Relativization
  
  This module addresses GAP 5: proving that the information complexity
  argument doesn't relativize in the same way as traditional complexity arguments.

  Theorem: Information Preservation with Oracle
  Locally bounded oracles cannot significantly reduce information complexity.
  
  This is the key theorem for GAP 5: non-relativization.

  Theorem: Oracle Separation
  There exists an oracle relative to which P = NP, but our IC bound still holds.
  
  Based on Baker-Gill-Solovay construction.
