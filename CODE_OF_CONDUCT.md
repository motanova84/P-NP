# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of
age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics,
gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic
status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community and research advancement
* Showing empathy towards other community members
* Providing and accepting rigorous scientific critique

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* Harassment, trolling, or personal attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information without permission
* Unprofessional conduct or behavior unbefitting academic discourse
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate

## Academic and Scientific Standards

This project deals with theoretical computer science and mathematical proofs.
We encourage:

* **Rigorous peer review**: All theoretical claims should be subject to scrutiny
* **Constructive criticism**: Point out errors or gaps in reasoning respectfully
* **Acknowledgment of limitations**: Be clear about what is proven vs. conjectured
* **Proper attribution**: Cite prior work and acknowledge contributions
* **Reproducibility**: Share methods, code, and data where appropriate

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards
of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, including issues,
pull requests, code reviews, and any public spaces where individuals are
representing the project.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the project team. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated
and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the
circumstances.
