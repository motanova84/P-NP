# Path Graph Acyclicity

Pure combinatorial proof that the finite path graph on `n` vertices is acyclic.

This fills the `sorry` in `CycleTreeDecomposition.lean` (`tree_is_acyclic`)
and `SimpleTreewidth.lean` (`pathGraph_is_tree`).

## Strategy

**Step 1 — Discrete IVT.**  Any walk in the path graph from vertex `a` to vertex `b`
(with `b.val < k < a.val`) contains a vertex with value `k`.
Proved by structural induction on the walk.

**Step 2 — Main theorem.**  Suppose for contradiction that `c : Walk v v` is a cycle.
Write `c = cons hadj q`.  From `cons_isCycle_iff`:
- `q.IsPath`   (each vertex visited at most once, in particular `q.support.Nodup`)
- `s(v, w) ∉ q.edges`   (the opening edge `{v, w}` is not reused)

Reverse `q` to inspect its last step:  `q.reverse = cons hadj_last r`.
The last edge `s(v, z)` of `q` must differ from `s(v, w)` (trail condition),
so `z ≠ w` and therefore `z` lies on the *opposite* side of `v` from `w`.
By the IVT, `v` appears in `r.support`.  But `q.support.Nodup` and
`q.support.reverse = v :: r.support` imply `v ∉ r.support`.  Contradiction.
