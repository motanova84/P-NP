# P-NP: Theoretical Framework for Complexity Analysis

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## üìö Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive theoretical framework for analyzing the P vs NP problem through the lens of **information complexity** and **treewidth**. The project explores novel approaches to one of the most important open questions in theoretical computer science using formal methods, mathematical rigor, and empirical validation.

## üéØ Project Goals

The primary objective of this research is to investigate the relationship between computational complexity and graph-theoretic properties, specifically:

- **Treewidth Analysis**: Understanding how the treewidth of problem instances relates to computational hardness
- **Information Complexity Bounds**: Applying information-theoretic principles to establish lower bounds on computation
- **Formal Verification**: Using proof assistants (Lean 4) to formalize mathematical arguments
- **Empirical Validation**: Testing theoretical predictions on real-world SAT instances

## üß† The P vs NP Problem

The P vs NP problem asks whether every problem whose solution can be quickly verified can also be quickly solved. More formally:

- **P**: The class of problems solvable in polynomial time
- **NP**: The class of problems whose solutions can be verified in polynomial time

This repository explores approaches to this problem using:

1. **Graph Minor Theory** (Robertson-Seymour): Metric properties of treewidth
2. **Information Complexity** (Braverman-Rao): Fundamental information-theoretic bounds
3. **Communication Complexity**: Protocol-based lower bound techniques
4. **Expander Graphs**: Pseudorandom structures for hardness constructions

## üìÇ Repository Structure

This is a research repository that contains theoretical frameworks and proof sketches. The main components include:

- **Formal Proofs**: Lean 4 formalizations of key theorems (when present)
- **Documentation**: Detailed mathematical write-ups and proof strategies
- **Examples**: Demonstration code and test cases
- **Research Notes**: Analysis and exploration of different approaches

## üî¨ Research Approach

The framework proposes several key innovations:

### 1. Structural Coupling via Treewidth

The project investigates the hypothesis that computational hardness is fundamentally tied to the treewidth of problem instances:

```
œÜ ‚àà P ‚ü∫ tw(G_I(œÜ)) = O(log n)
```

Where:
- `œÜ` is a CNF formula (Boolean satisfiability problem)
- `G_I(œÜ)` is the incidence graph of œÜ
- `tw(G_I(œÜ))` is the treewidth
- `n` is the number of variables

### 2. Information-Theoretic Barriers

Unlike approaches relying on unproven assumptions (SETH, ETH), this work explores information complexity as a potential avenue for unconditional lower bounds.

### 3. Non-Relativization

The framework aims to avoid the relativization barrier that affects many complexity-theoretic approaches by leveraging structural properties that don't relativize.

## üìñ Key Concepts

### Treewidth

Treewidth is a graph-theoretic measure of how "tree-like" a graph is. Graphs with low treewidth admit efficient dynamic programming algorithms, while high treewidth often correlates with computational hardness.

### Information Complexity

Information complexity measures the minimum amount of information that must be revealed by a communication protocol to compute a function. It provides lower bounds that are more robust than traditional complexity measures.

### Tseitin Formulas

Tseitin formulas are special CNF constructions over graphs that are satisfiable if and only if the graph has an even number of odd-degree vertices. When constructed over expander graphs, they exhibit high treewidth and serve as hard instances.
