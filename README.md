# P-NP: Computational Dichotomy via Treewidth and Information Complexity

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A **proposed** formal framework for analyzing the P vs NP problem through the lens of treewidth and information complexity, featuring **Lemma 6.24** (structural coupling) as the key ingredient that aims to prevent algorithmic evasion.

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** This is a research proposal and theoretical framework under development. The claims herein have **not been peer-reviewed** and should **not** be treated as established results. Rigorous verification is required.

**🚀 Quick Start:** See [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md) for installation and running instructions.

## 🎯 Proposed Main Result

**Computational Dichotomy Theorem (Proposed):**
```
φ ∈ P ⟺ tw(G_I(φ)) = O(log n)  (if validated)
```

Where:
- `φ` is a CNF formula
- `G_I(φ)` is the incidence graph of φ
- `tw(G_I(φ))` is the treewidth of the incidence graph
- `n` is the number of variables

## ✨ The Key Ingredient: Proposed Mechanism to Prevent Evasion

**Lemma 6.24 (Structural Coupling Preserving Treewidth)** proposes that:

> Any CNF formula φ with high treewidth can be coupled via gadgets (Tseitin expanders or graph product padding) to a communication instance where the information bottleneck is **inherent and cannot be eliminated** by classical algorithmic techniques.

**Note:** This is a proposed mechanism requiring rigorous proof.

This approach is **NOT based on SETH or ETH**, but instead aims to use:
1. Metric properties of treewidth (Graph Minors, Robertson-Seymour)
2. Duality between resolution, branching programs, and communication
3. Correlation decay properties in expander graphs

## 📚 Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive theoretical framework for analyzing the P vs NP problem through the lens of **information complexity** and **treewidth**. The project explores novel approaches to one of the most important open questions in theoretical computer science using formal methods, mathematical rigor, and empirical validation.

## 🎯 Project Goals

The primary objective of this research is to investigate the relationship between computational complexity and graph-theoretic properties, specifically:

- **Treewidth Analysis**: Understanding how the treewidth of problem instances relates to computational hardness
- **Information Complexity Bounds**: Applying information-theoretic principles to establish lower bounds on computation
- **Formal Verification**: Using proof assistants (Lean 4) to formalize mathematical arguments
- **Empirical Validation**: Testing theoretical predictions on real-world SAT instances

## 🧠 The P vs NP Problem

The P vs NP problem asks whether every problem whose solution can be quickly verified can also be quickly solved. More formally:

- **P**: The class of problems solvable in polynomial time
- **NP**: The class of problems whose solutions can be verified in polynomial time

This repository explores approaches to this problem using:

1. **Graph Minor Theory** (Robertson-Seymour): Metric properties of treewidth
2. **Information Complexity** (Braverman-Rao): Fundamental information-theoretic bounds
3. **Communication Complexity**: Protocol-based lower bound techniques
4. **Expander Graphs**: Pseudorandom structures for hardness constructions

## 🔬 Research Approach

The framework proposes several key innovations:

### 1. Structural Coupling via Treewidth

The project investigates the hypothesis that computational hardness is fundamentally tied to the treewidth of problem instances:

```
φ ∈ P if and only if tw(G_I(φ)) = O(log n)
```

Where:
- `φ` is a CNF formula (Boolean satisfiability problem)
- `G_I(φ)` is the incidence graph of φ
- `tw(G_I(φ))` is the treewidth
- `n` is the number of variables

### 2. Information-Theoretic Barriers

Unlike approaches relying on unproven assumptions (SETH, ETH), this work explores information complexity as a potential avenue for unconditional lower bounds.

### 3. Non-Relativization

The framework aims to avoid the relativization barrier that affects many complexity-theoretic approaches by leveraging structural properties that don't relativize.

## 🧠 Theoretical Foundation

### The Dichotomy Theorem

**Part 1: Upper Bound** (tw ≤ O(log n) → φ ∈ P)
- Uses dynamic programming FPT algorithm
- Time: `2^O(tw) · n^O(1) = 2^O(log n) · n^O(1) = poly(n)`

**Part 2: Lower Bound** (tw = ω(log n) → φ ∉ P)
- High treewidth → communication protocol with high IC
- IC(Π | S) ≥ α·tw(φ) → time ≥ 2^Ω(tw)
- Structural coupling prevents evasion

### Why No Algorithm Can Evade

The **no-evasion theorem** proves that:

1. **Any algorithmic strategy** (DPLL, CDCL, neural networks, etc.) implicitly induces a communication protocol
2. **That protocol must traverse** the IC bottleneck if tw(G_I) is high
3. **Therefore, time ≥ 2^Ω(tw/log tw)** is unavoidable

This includes all algorithms:
- Traditional SAT solvers (DPLL, CDCL)
- Quantum algorithms
- Randomized algorithms
- Machine learning approaches
- Any future algorithmic paradigm

## 📊 Argument Structure

| Element | Role |
|---------|------|
| tw(G_I) | Structural measure of incidence graph |
| Expander Tseitin | Non-evadable communication bottlenecks |
| Braverman-Rao | Minimum information flow control |
| Pinsker inequality | Precision → information requirement |
| Structural coupling | Forces interdependent subproblem solving |
| IC lower bound | IC ≥ Ω(tw/log n) for sparse G_I |
| Non-evasion | IC collapse → contradiction |

## 📖 Key Concepts

### Treewidth

Treewidth is a graph-theoretic measure of how "tree-like" a graph is. Graphs with low treewidth admit efficient dynamic programming algorithms, while high treewidth often correlates with computational hardness.

### Information Complexity

Information complexity measures the minimum amount of information that must be revealed by a communication protocol to compute a function. It provides lower bounds that are more robust than traditional complexity measures.

### Tseitin Formulas

Tseitin formulas are special CNF constructions over graphs that are satisfiable if and only if the graph has an even number of odd-degree vertices. When constructed over expander graphs, they exhibit high treewidth and serve as hard instances.

## 🔮 Potential Implications

**If this framework is validated** (which requires rigorous proof):
- ✅ P ≠ NP could be resolved via treewidth characterization
- ✅ No SETH/ETH assumptions would be needed
- ✅ Constructive characterization of tractable problems
- ✅ Would apply to all algorithmic paradigms

**However:** These are potential outcomes contingent on successful validation of the framework.
