[![Lean 4 CI](https://github.com/motanova84/P-NP/workflows/Lean%204%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/motanova84/P-NP/actions)

A **formal framework** for analyzing the P vs NP problem through the lens of treewidth and information complexity, featuring **Lemma 6.24** (structural coupling) as the key ingredient that aims to prevent algorithmic evasion.

## üéØ Proposed Main Result

**Computational Dichotomy Theorem (Proposed):**
```
œÜ ‚àà P ‚ü∫ tw(G_I(œÜ)) = O(log n)
```

Where:
- `œÜ` is a CNF formula
- `G_I(œÜ)` is the incidence graph of œÜ  
- `tw(G_I(œÜ))` is the treewidth of the incidence graph
- `n` is the number of variables

## üß™ Lean 4 Formalization

## ‚ú® The Key Insight: Structural Coupling

**Lemma 6.24 (Treewidth-Preserving Structural Coupling)** proposes that:

> Any CNF formula œÜ with high treewidth can be coupled via gadgets (Tseitin expanders) to a communication instance where the information bottleneck is inherent and cannot be eliminated by classical algorithmic techniques.

This approach uses:

- **Treewidth** as a structural complexity measure
- **Information Complexity** for unconditional lower bounds
- **Expander Graphs** to create non-evadable bottlenecks
- **Formal Verification** via Lean 4 for rigorous proof checking

## üìö Theoretical Framework

### Core Components

1. **Treewidth Analysis**: Connecting graph structure to computational hardness
2. **Information Complexity Bounds**: Using information-theoretic limits
