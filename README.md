# P-NP: Computational Dichotomy via Treewidth and Information Complexity

A formal framework for analyzing the P vs NP problem through the lens of treewidth and information complexity, featuring **Lemma 6.24** (structural coupling) as the key ingredient that prevents algorithmic evasion.

## 🎯 Main Result

**Computational Dichotomy Theorem:**
```
φ ∈ P ⟺ tw(G_I(φ)) = O(log n)
```

Where:
- `φ` is a CNF formula
- `G_I(φ)` is the incidence graph of φ
- `tw(G_I(φ))` is the treewidth of the incidence graph
- `n` is the number of variables

## ✨ The Key Ingredient: Why Algorithms Cannot Evade

**Lemma 6.24 (Structural Coupling Preserving Treewidth)** establishes that:

> Any CNF formula φ with high treewidth can be coupled via gadgets (Tseitin expanders or graph product padding) to a communication instance where the information bottleneck is **inherent and cannot be eliminated** by classical algorithmic techniques.

This is **NOT based on SETH or ETH**, but on:
1. Metric properties of treewidth (Graph Minors, Robertson-Seymour)
2. Duality between resolution, branching programs, and communication
3. Correlation decay properties in expander graphs

## 🧠 Theoretical Foundation

### The Dichotomy Theorem

**Part 1: Upper Bound** (tw ≤ O(log n) → φ ∈ P)
- Uses dynamic programming FPT algorithm
- Time: `2^O(tw) · n^O(1) = 2^O(log n) · n^O(1) = poly(n)`

**Part 2: Lower Bound** (tw = ω(log n) → φ ∉ P)
- High treewidth → communication protocol with high IC
- IC(Π | S) ≥ α·tw(φ) → time ≥ 2^Ω(tw)
- Structural coupling prevents evasion

### Why No Algorithm Can Evade

The **no-evasion theorem** proves that:

1. **Any algorithmic strategy** (DPLL, CDCL, neural networks, etc.) implicitly induces a communication protocol
2. **That protocol must traverse** the IC bottleneck if tw(G_I) is high
3. **Therefore, time ≥ 2^Ω(tw/log tw)** is unavoidable

This includes all algorithms:
- Traditional SAT solvers (DPLL, CDCL)
- Quantum algorithms
- Randomized algorithms
- Machine learning approaches
- Any future algorithmic paradigm
