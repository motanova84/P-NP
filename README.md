# P-NP Framework: Formal Verification Approach

[![Lean 4 CI](https://github.com/motanova84/P-NP/workflows/Lean%204%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/motanova84/P-NP/actions)

## Overview

This repository contains a formal framework for approaching the P vs NP problem through information complexity and treewidth analysis. The approach aims to prove superlinear lower bounds for SAT by connecting:

1. **Treewidth** of problem structure
2. **Information Complexity** of communication protocols
3. **Computational Lower Bounds** for algorithms

## The Six Critical Gaps

### 🔒 GAP 1: From Treewidth to Universal Limit

**Goal**: Prove that if the incidence graph has treewidth ω(1), then every algorithm must have complexity ≥ α·k.

**Status**: Framework implemented, proofs use `sorry` placeholders.

**Key Theorems**:
- `no_bypass_theorem`: Any SAT algorithm induces a communication protocol
- `universal_compression_barrier`: Meta-theorem connecting all components
- `tight_sat_reduction`: Reduction preserves treewidth without overhead

### 🚧 GAP 2: Strengthen Information Bounds

**Goal**: Improve α from ≈ 0.006 to Ω(1) (e.g., α ≥ 0.1).

**Status**: Framework for improved bounds implemented.

**Key Theorems**:
- `strengthened_separator_bound`: Improved version of SILB
- `recalibrated_parameters`: Better gadget constructions
- Target: `ρ ≥ 0.9` (cross-correlation)

### 💻 GAP 3: Lean 4 Formalization

**Goal**: Complete formal verification with no `sorry` statements.

**Status**: ✅ Structure complete, proofs in progress.

**Progress**:
- ✅ Project structure and build system
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline configured
- ✅ Core modules defined
- 🔄 Proof completion ongoing

### 🧯 GAP 4: Refute Counterexamples

**Goal**: Address potential counterexamples to the approach.

**Status**: Refutations formalized.

**Counterexamples Addressed**:
- ✅ **A**: Padding creates patterns → Pseudorandom expanders
- ✅ **B**: Only for clean protocols → Algorithm simulation
- ✅ **C**: Reduction kills constant → Logarithmic overhead bound

### 🌀 GAP 5: Non-Relativization

**Goal**: Prove the information complexity argument doesn't relativize.

**Status**: Framework implemented with oracle theory.

**Key Theorems**:
- `information_preservation_oracle`: Locally bounded oracles preserve IC
- `oracle_separation`: Baker-Gill-Solovay-style construction

### 📊 GAP 6: Empirical Validation

**Goal**: Validate bounds on real SAT instances.

**Status**: ✅ Python validation tools implemented.

**Features**:
- Treewidth estimation on random 3-SAT
- Information complexity bound calculation
- Comparison with CryptoMiniSat, Kissat, MiniSat
- Statistical analysis and reporting

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Lean 4**: Install via [elan](https://github.com/leanprover/elan)
- **Python 3.8+**: For empirical validation
- **SAT Solvers** (optional): cryptominisat5, kissat, minisat

### Building the Lean Project

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/motanova84/P-NP.git
cd P-NP

# Build with Lake
lake build

# Run the main executable
lake exe pnp
```

### Running Empirical Validation

```bash
cd python_validation

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run validation
python empirical_validation.py

# Benchmark against solvers (requires solvers installed)
python solver_comparison.py
```

## Mathematical Framework

### Core Concepts

1. **Incidence Graph**: Bipartite graph connecting variables to clauses
2. **Treewidth**: Measure of how tree-like a graph is
3. **Information Complexity (IC)**: Minimum information revealed in protocols
4. **Separator**: Cut-set in protocol tree
5. **SILB**: Separation-Induced Lower Bound technique

### Main Theorem (Informal)

```
For any algorithm A solving SAT:
  If treewidth(G_I) = ω(1), then
  Time(A) ≥ α · k
  
where:
  - G_I is the incidence graph
  - k relates to treewidth
  - α > 0 is a universal constant
```

### Current Challenges

1. **Constant α**: Currently ≈ 0.006, need Ω(1)
2. **Proof Gaps**: Several `sorry` statements remain
3. **Tightness**: Ensuring reductions don't introduce slack
4. **Empirical Validation**: More extensive testing needed

## Contributing

This is a research project. Contributions welcome in:

1. **Proof Completion**: Replacing `sorry` with actual proofs
2. **Bound Improvement**: Better analysis for larger α
3. **Validation**: More empirical testing
4. **Documentation**: Explanations and examples

## Theoretical Background

### Key Papers (Conceptual Foundation)

- **Treewidth and SAT**: Understanding structural complexity
- **Information Complexity**: Barak et al., Bar-Yossef et al.
- **Expander Graphs**: Hoory-Linial-Wigderson survey
- **Communication Complexity**: Kushilevitz-Nisan textbook

### Proof Strategy

1. **Construct hard instances** with high treewidth
2. **Pad with expanders** to eliminate local structure exploitation
3. **Simulate any algorithm** as a communication protocol
4. **Apply IC lower bounds** using SILB technique
5. **Translate back** to computational lower bounds

## Current Status

### What Works

✅ Complete project structure  
✅ All core modules defined in Lean 4  
✅ CI/CD pipeline operational  
✅ Empirical validation tools  
✅ Documentation framework  

### What's In Progress

🔄 Completing formal proofs (removing `sorry`)  
🔄 Improving constant α  
🔄 More extensive empirical testing  
🔄 Peer review and verification  

### Known Issues

- Many theorems use `sorry` (proof placeholders)
- Constant α is too small (≈ 0.006 vs target Ω(1))
- Need more rigorous treewidth preservation proof
- Empirical validation needs larger test suite
