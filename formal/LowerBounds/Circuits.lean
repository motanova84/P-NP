# Circuit Lower Bounds from Information Complexity

This module translates information complexity lower bounds into
circuit size lower bounds, completing the proof pipeline from
treewidth to computational complexity.

## Main Results

* `circuit_lower_bound`: High information complexity implies large circuits
* `pnp_separation`: Under the structural assumptions, P ≠ NP

## Implementation Notes

This is a stub implementation. The full proof requires:
- Formalization of Boolean circuits
- Translation from communication protocols to circuits
- Composition with lifting theorems
- Connection to standard complexity classes P and NP

Circuit Lower Bound Theorem.

Any function requiring high information complexity in communication protocols
also requires large circuits.

Translation from protocol to circuit.

Any communication protocol can be simulated by a circuit,
with size proportional to the protocol complexity.

/-- 
Main Separation Theorem (P ≠ NP).

Under the structural assumptions (high treewidth for NP-complete problems,
gadget preservation of information complexity), we establish P ≠ NP.

This is a stub that connects all the pieces. The full proof requires:
1. SILB lemma (separator_information_lower_bound)
2. Gadget validity (gadget_validity)
3. Lifting theorem (lifting_theorem)
4. Circuit lower bound (circuit_lower_bound)

Treewidth Dichotomy.

A Boolean function is in P if and only if its incidence graph
has logarithmic treewidth.

/-- 
Non-Relativization.

The proof does not relativize because it depends on
explicit graph structure, not oracle queries.

  trivial

/-- 
Non-Natural Proof.

The proof is not a natural proof (Razborov-Rudich) because
the predicates are not dense and not efficiently computable.
-/
theorem non_natural_proof : True := by
  trivial

/-- 
Non-Algebrization.

The proof does not algebrize because separator information
monotonicity breaks in algebraic extensions.

  trivial
