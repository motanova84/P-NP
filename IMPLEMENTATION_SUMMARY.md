This repository contains a **proposed theoretical framework** for analyzing P vs NP through treewidth and information complexity. Here's what you'll find:

### ‚úÖ Complete Components

**What Works:** Comprehensive explanations of all concepts  
**Note:** All documentation includes appropriate disclaimers

### ‚ö†Ô∏è What This Is NOT

This implementation is **NOT**:
- ‚ùå A complete proof of P ‚â† NP
- ‚ùå A peer-reviewed result
- ‚ùå An established theorem
- ‚ùå Ready for citation in academic work
- ‚ùå Guaranteed to be correct

### ‚úì What This IS

This implementation **IS**:
- ‚úÖ A proposed theoretical framework
- ‚úÖ A computational demonstration of the concepts
- ‚úÖ A starting point for research and discussion
- ‚úÖ A formalization effort for validation
- ‚úÖ Open to critical analysis and peer review

## How to Use This Repository

### For Understanding the Framework

## Key Concepts Implemented

### Treewidth
- Definition and computation
- Relationship to problem complexity
- Tree decomposition construction

### Information Complexity
- Communication protocol framework
- Braverman-Rao conditioned IC
- Lower bound calculations

### Structural Coupling (Lemma 6.24)
- Tseitin expander construction
- Graph product padding
- IC bottleneck preservation

### Non-Evasion Property
- Algorithm-to-protocol reduction
- Topology preservation argument
- Universal time lower bounds

## Testing and Validation Status

### ‚úÖ Tested and Working

- Examples produce expected output
- Treewidth computation gives reasonable results
- Framework demonstrates concepts clearly

### ‚ùì Requires Validation

- Mathematical correctness of all proofs
- Tightness of all bounds

## Important Reminders

1. **This is research in progress** - not established fact
2. **Claims require validation** - don't assume correctness
3. **Be skeptical and critical** - that's good science
4. **Documentation may contain errors** - help us find them
5. **Peer review is essential** - this hasn't happened yet
