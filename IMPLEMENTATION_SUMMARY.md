# Implementation Summary: P≠NP Anti-Barriers Documentation

## Completed: 2025-10-30

This document summarizes the changes made to implement the P≠NP anti-barriers documentation and formal verification stubs as specified in the problem statement.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Manuscript Documentation (docs/formal_manuscript.tex)

  - Explains why SILB depends on separator structure, not oracle queries
  - Details structural dependence on $G_I(\phi)$ topology
  - Shows gadget specificity prevents oracle simulation
  
- **Non-Natural Proofs (Subsection 6.2)**
  - Demonstrates predicates are not dense
  - Shows treewidth computation is NP-hard (not efficiently constructible)
