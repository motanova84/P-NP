# Project Status Overview

## Executive Summary

This project formalizes an approach to proving P ‚â† NP via information complexity and treewidth analysis. The framework is **complete but unproven** - all theorems are stated, but proofs use `sorry` placeholders pending rigorous completion.

## GAP 4: Counterexample Refutations üü¢

### Objective
Formally refute potential counterexamples

### What's Done ‚úÖ
- [x] Module `CounterexampleRefutations.lean`
- [x] Refutation A: Padding patterns
- [x] Refutation B: Clean protocols only
- [x] Refutation C: Reduction overhead

### Counterexamples Addressed

**A: Padding Creates Patterns**
- Claim: Expander padding introduces exploitable structure
- Refutation: Pseudorandom property ensures cycles distributed like Erd≈ës-R√©nyi
- Status: Formalized, needs proof

**B: Only for Clean Protocols**
- Claim: Argument only works for specific protocol types
- Refutation: Every algorithm induces protocol via read/write simulation
- Status: Formalized, needs proof

**C: Reduction Kills Constant**
- Claim: SAT reduction overhead makes Œ± meaningless
- Refutation: Overhead ‚â§ O(log n), bound Œ±k ‚â• log n still holds
- Status: Formalized, needs proof

### Next Steps
1. Complete proofs for refutations
2. Add more potential counterexamples
3. Stress-test argument against attacks

**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 months

## GAP 5: Non-Relativization üü°

### Objective
Prove IC argument doesn't relativize like traditional complexity arguments

### What's Done ‚úÖ
- [x] Oracle complexity module
- [x] Oracle structure definition
- [x] Theorem statements for oracle preservation
- [x] Baker-Gill-Solovay-style framework

### What's Missing ‚ùå
- [ ] Explicit oracle construction

- [ ] Proof that IC(f|O) ‚â• IC(f) - Œµ
- [ ] Locally bounded oracle characterization

### Why It Matters
Traditional P ‚â† NP attempts often fail because they relativize. Showing our argument doesn't relativize would be a strong indicator of correctness.

### Next Steps (Q2 2026)
1. Construct explicit oracle
2. Prove oracle separation
3. Show IC preservation
4. Document why IC is special

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 months

---------  -------  ------------  ----------
50         8.0      0.048         0.80
