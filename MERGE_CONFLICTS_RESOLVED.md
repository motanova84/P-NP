**Date:** 2025-10-20  
**Branches Merged:** `copilot/verify-project-build` â†’ `copilot/create-complete-lean-structure`  
**Commit:** 0f534d8

## Overview

Successfully resolved all merge conflicts between the two branches. The resolution strategy was to keep the more comprehensive and complete versions from the current branch (`copilot/create-complete-lean-structure`) while integrating the new files from `copilot/verify-project-build`.

## Files with Conflicts Resolved

### 1. .gitignore
**Resolution:** Kept HEAD version (comprehensive unified .gitignore)
- Includes Python, Lean, IDE, OS, and CI/Cache sections
- More complete than the simple Lean-only version from verify-project-build

### 2. Main.lean
**Resolution:** Kept HEAD version (ComputationalDichotomy import)
- Simpler, cleaner main entry point
- Consistent with the existing project structure

### 3. QUICKSTART.md
**Resolution:** Kept HEAD version (comprehensive guide)
- Includes both Python and Lean instructions
- More detailed with complete test examples
- Better suited for the hybrid Python+Lean project

### 4. README.md
**Resolution:** Kept HEAD version (detailed documentation)
- Complete project structure overview
- Detailed explanation of the computational dichotomy approach
- Comprehensive documentation of all components

### 5. lakefile.lean
**Resolution:** Kept HEAD version (PNP package with mathlib)
- Package name: PNP
- Includes mathlib v4.12.0 dependency
- ComputationalDichotomy library configuration
- Director as root for executable

### 6. lean-toolchain
**Resolution:** Kept HEAD version (Lean 4.12.0)
- More recent version: leanprover/lean4:4.12.0
- Better compatibility with mathlib v4.12.0
